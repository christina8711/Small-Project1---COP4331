# Small-Project1---COP4331

Your small project is a **contact manager**.

From the front page:
1. Support user logins, and account creation.
2. Once logged in, users can create, update, retrieve and delete contacts.
3. Contacts must have at least names and e-mails.

## You must:

- [ ] Use a LAMP stack.  (Hint: Deploy the in-class project yourself and look at it to understand LAMP stacks.)
- [ ] Deploy the project remotely.
- [ ] Have a DNS address.
- [ ] Use Web pages that use JSON-formatted APIs to connect to a PHP-brokered database backend, all on that server.
- [ ] Actually search the database - do not cache all contacts client-side.
- [ ] You must have coherent roles as we discussed.  Fill your roles out on [the Google sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SXE0B8JLAY1rMQREVuTMVeK2j-EDCdCOyNj5-PqF89k/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- [ ] Also include your Github and Discord links.  (I won't use the Discord link, but it'll help you keep track if it.)

## The Presentation
You won't just develop this app, you'll present it.  
**Presentations will begin in Week 5**
watch for your date (it'll be on that Google sheet).

**Each presentation will be a little over ten minutes, and will need a near-professional-level Powerpoint with:**

- [ ] A title slide.
- [ ] A slide with your team members and their roles.
- [ ] Your technologies.
- [ ] What went well.
- [ ] What didn't.
- [ ] A Gantt chart.
- [ ] Your ERD.
- [ ] You'll wrap up with a quick app demonstration, an equally quick API demonstration, and time for questions.

### Presenting Both
The due date is near the end of September, but **your real due date is based on your presentation date:** You must submit your PowerPoint slides [here](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1469031/assignments/8671718?module_item_id=18767633), and fill out your row in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SXE0B8JLAY1rMQREVuTMVeK2j-EDCdCOyNj5-PqF89k/edit?gid=0#gid=0), before your presentation.

**Attendance for all presentations (not just yours) is mandatory.**
For your presentation, be ready!  

- [ ] Have a laptop or USB stick ready to go - don't try to hunt around on Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive on presentation day.

- [ ] Your whole team has to participate in the presentation - saying "hi" is not enough.
